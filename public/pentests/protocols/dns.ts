//! Getting zone file with a dns record transfer
// only works is there no authentication
// dig axfr @{ip} {domain-name}
//! Brute forcing subdomains
// dnsenum --dnsserver {dns-ip} --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f subdomains-top1million-110000.txt {domain-name}
//! Finding all records of a domain
// at ctf/subbrute
// python3 subbrute.py -r resolvers.txt -p {domain}
//! Subdomain takeover
// Subdomain takeover exploits forgotten DNS records (e.g., CNAME) pointing to nonexistent third-party services,
// allowing attackers to register and control these subdomains.
// This enables phishing, cookie theft, CSRF, or bypassing security policies,
// as the subdomain appears legitimate under the company's domain.
